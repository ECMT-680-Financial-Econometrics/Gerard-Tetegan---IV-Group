# Project: Replication of Work by Nathan Nunn (THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF AFRICAâ€™S SLAVE TRADES)

## Overview
This project aims to replicate the research conducted by Nathan Nunn.
The provided data files have been sourced from his website and include shape files and data tables necessary for the analysis.
The analyses were performed using Python, focusing on reproducing the main ideas presented in Nunn's work.

## Data Files
The data files uploaded to this repository include:
- borders_tribes.dbf
- borders_tribes.prj
- borders_tribes.sbn
- borders_tribes.sbx
- borders_tribes.shp
- borders_tribes.shp.xml
- borders_tribes.shx
- slave_trade_QJE.dta

### Shape files:
These ESRI Shapefiles contain geographical information, such as boundaries, polygons, and other spatial data, necessary for spatial analysis.
They delineate the geographical regions under study, providing a framework for spatial analysis.

### Data tables:
The main data table file is in Stata format (.dta).
This dataset includes the target variable, representing the primary outcome or phenomenon of interest, along with corresponding independent variables.
These independent variables encompass endogenous, exogenous, and instrumental variables, which play distinct roles in the analysis.

## Python Analysis
The analysis was carried out using Python.
Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and others were used to replicate the main ideas presented in Nathan Nunn's work.

## Instructions
To replicate the analyses conducted in this project, follow these steps:
- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries specified in the requirements.txt file.
- Use the provided data files to run the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks included in this repository.
- Analyze the results and compare them with the findings of Nathan Nunn's work.

## Note
This project is for educational and research purposes only.
The provided data files are sourced from Nathan Nunn's website for replication purposes.
Any findings or interpretations presented in this project are solely based on the analyses conducted and may not reflect the original conclusions of Nathan Nunn's work.
