\section*{Objective}
This study aims to quantify the long-term effects of Africa's slave trades on contemporary economic development, investigating how the historical exportation of slaves has impacted the economic performance of affected countries.

\section*{Methodology \& Instrument}
Using historical data on slave exports and employing an instrumental variable approach, the research establishes a causal relationship between the intensity of slave exports and current economic underdevelopment across nations within Africa.

\section*{Reason}
The research addresses a significant gap in understanding the historical determinants of economic development by directly linking the slave trades to persistent economic disparities observed in Africa today.

\section*{Data}
The study compiles comprehensive data on the number of slaves exported from each African country during the transatlantic, Indian Ocean, and trans-Saharan slave trades, correlating these figures with current economic performance indicators.

\section*{Results}
The findings reveal a significant negative impact of the slave trades on current economic development. Countries from which the most slaves were exported are shown to be significantly poorer today, suggesting a lasting legacy of the slave trades on African economic development.
